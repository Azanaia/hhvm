WARN: File "null_constraint.php", line 27, characters 7-10:
This is a sketchy null check on an expression of type T.
It detects nulls, but it will also detect many other falsy values, including `false`, `0`, `0.0`, `""`, `"0"`, empty Containers, and more.
If you want to test for them, please consider doing so explicitly.
If you only meant to test for `null`, use `$arg is nonnull` instead (Warn[12003])
WARN: File "null_constraint.php", line 27, characters 7-10:
`$arg` is a sketchy condition: testing the truthiness of a string may not behave as expected.
The values `""` and `"0"` are both considered falsy. To check for non-emptiness, use `!Str\is_empty($arg)`. (Warn[12006])
