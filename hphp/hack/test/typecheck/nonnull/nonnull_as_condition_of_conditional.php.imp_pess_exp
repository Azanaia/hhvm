WARN: File "nonnull_as_condition_of_conditional.php", line 4, characters 7-8:
This is a sketchy null check on an expression of type nonnull.
It detects nulls, but it will also detect many other falsy values, including `false`, `0`, `0.0`, `""`, `"0"`, empty Containers, and more.
If you want to test for them, please consider doing so explicitly.
If you only meant to test for `null`, use `$x is nonnull` instead (Warn[12003])
