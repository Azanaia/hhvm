warning: Warn[12003] This is a sketchy null check on an expression of type supportdyn<mixed>.
It detects nulls, but it will also detect many other falsy values, including false, 0, 0.0, "", "0", empty Containers, and more.
If you want to test for them, please consider doing so explicitly.
If you only meant to test for null, use $sd is nonnull instead [1]
