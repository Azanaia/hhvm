error: Typing[4110] Invalid return type

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 8, character 10 - line 8, character 11:

 7 | function inter_r(C $c) : (A & I) {
 8 |   return »$c«;
 9 | }

Expected `I`

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 7, character 31 - line 7, character 31:

 7 | function inter_r(C $c) : (A & »I«) {
 8 |   return $c;
 9 | }

But got `C`

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 7, character 18 - line 7, character 18:

 7 | function inter_r(»C« $c) : (A & I) {
 8 |   return $c;
 9 | }

Here's why:

Step 1 of 2

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this hint

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 7, character 18 - line 7, character 18:

 7 | function inter_r(»C« $c) : (A & I) {
 8 |   return $c;
 9 | }

and flows into this expression as the parameter hint

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 8, character 3 - line 8, character 12:

 7 | function inter_r(C $c) : (A & I) {
 8 |   »return $c;«
 9 | }

The supertype comes from this hint

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 7, character 26 - line 7, character 32:

 7 | function inter_r(C $c) : »(A & I)« {
 8 |   return $c;
 9 | }

Step 2 of 2 (here is where the error occurred)

The supertype is an intersection type so next I checked the subtype constraint is satsified for all of its elements.

The subtype is the same as before.

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 7, character 18 - line 7, character 18:

 7 | function inter_r(»C« $c) : (A & I) {
 8 |   return $c;
 9 | }

The supertype comes from this hint

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 7, character 31 - line 7, character 31:

 7 | function inter_r(C $c) : (A & »I«) {
 8 |   return $c;
 9 | }
