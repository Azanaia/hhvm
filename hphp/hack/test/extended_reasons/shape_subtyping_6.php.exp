error: Typing[4163] Invalid argument

 11 | function passes_optional_a_at_bool_alias(
 12 |   optional_a_at_bool $s,
 13 | ): void {

 15 | }

The field `a` is **optional**

File "shape_subtyping_6.php", line 12, character 3 - line 12, character 20:

 11 | function passes_optional_a_at_bool_alias(
 12 |   »optional_a_at_bool« $s,
 13 | ): void {
 14 |   expects_required_a_at_int_alias($s);
 15 | }

The field `a` is defined as **required**

File "shape_subtyping_6.php", line 7, character 3 - line 7, character 19:

 3 | type required_a_at_int = shape('a' => int);
 4 | type optional_a_at_bool = shape(?'a' => bool);
 5 | 
 6 | function expects_required_a_at_int_alias(
 7 |   »required_a_at_int« $s,
 8 | ): void {
 9 | }

`a` is defined here

File "shape_subtyping_6.php", line 3, character 39 - line 3, character 41:

 3 | type required_a_at_int = shape('a' => »int«);
 4 | type optional_a_at_bool = shape(?'a' => bool);

Step 1 of 3

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this function or method declaration

File "shape_subtyping_6.php", line 6, character 10 - line 6, character 40:

 3 | type required_a_at_int = shape('a' => int);
 4 | type optional_a_at_bool = shape(?'a' => bool);
 5 | 
 6 | function »expects_required_a_at_int_alias«(
 7 |   required_a_at_int $s,
 8 | ): void {
 9 | }

The supertype comes from this expression

File "shape_subtyping_6.php", line 14, character 3 - line 14, character 37:

 11 | function passes_optional_a_at_bool_alias(
 12 |   optional_a_at_bool $s,
 13 | ): void {
 14 |   »expects_required_a_at_int_alias($s)«;
 15 | }

Step 2 of 3

These are function types so next I checked the 1st function parameter of the supertype and subtype were subtypes (functions are contravariant in their parameters so the direction of the subtype relationship is reversed).

The subtype comes from this hint

File "shape_subtyping_6.php", line 12, character 3 - line 12, character 20:

 11 | function passes_optional_a_at_bool_alias(
 12 |   »optional_a_at_bool« $s,
 13 | ): void {
 14 |   expects_required_a_at_int_alias($s);
 15 | }

which is defined here

File "shape_subtyping_6.php", line 4, character 6 - line 4, character 23:

 3 | type required_a_at_int = shape('a' => int);
 4 | type »optional_a_at_bool« = shape(?'a' => bool);
 5 | 
 6 | function expects_required_a_at_int_alias(
 7 |   required_a_at_int $s,
 8 | ): void {
 9 | }

and flows into this expression as the parameter hint

File "shape_subtyping_6.php", line 12, character 22 - line 12, character 23:

 11 | function passes_optional_a_at_bool_alias(
 12 |   optional_a_at_bool »$s«,
 13 | ): void {
 14 |   expects_required_a_at_int_alias($s);
 15 | }

which itself flows into this expression as the type of the local variable

File "shape_subtyping_6.php", line 14, character 35 - line 14, character 36:

 11 | function passes_optional_a_at_bool_alias(
 12 |   optional_a_at_bool $s,
 13 | ): void {
 14 |   expects_required_a_at_int_alias(»$s«);
 15 | }

The supertype comes from this hint

File "shape_subtyping_6.php", line 7, character 3 - line 7, character 19:

 3 | type required_a_at_int = shape('a' => int);
 4 | type optional_a_at_bool = shape(?'a' => bool);
 5 | 
 6 | function expects_required_a_at_int_alias(
 7 |   »required_a_at_int« $s,
 8 | ): void {
 9 | }

which is defined here

File "shape_subtyping_6.php", line 3, character 6 - line 3, character 22:

 3 | type »required_a_at_int« = shape('a' => int);
 4 | type optional_a_at_bool = shape(?'a' => bool);

Step 3 of 3

These are shape types so next I checked the `a` fields were subtypes. The field was optional in the subtype and required in the supertype.

This step is the cause of the error.

The subtype comes from this hint

File "shape_subtyping_6.php", line 4, character 41 - line 4, character 44:

 3 | type required_a_at_int = shape('a' => int);
 4 | type optional_a_at_bool = shape(?'a' => »bool«);
 5 | 
 6 | function expects_required_a_at_int_alias(
 7 |   required_a_at_int $s,
 8 | ): void {
 9 | }

The supertype comes from this hint

File "shape_subtyping_6.php", line 3, character 39 - line 3, character 41:

 3 | type required_a_at_int = shape('a' => »int«);
 4 | type optional_a_at_bool = shape(?'a' => bool);
