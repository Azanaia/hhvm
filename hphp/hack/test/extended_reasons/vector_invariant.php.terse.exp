error: Typing[4110] Invalid return type

File "vector_invariant.php", line 8, character 10 - line 8, character 11:

 7 |   // hh_force_solve();
 8 |   return »$z«;
 9 | }

Expected `int`

File "vector_invariant.php", line 3, character 24 - line 3, character 26:

 3 | function foo(): Vector<»int«> {
 4 |   $x =  Vector { 1 , '2' };
 5 |   $y = $x;
 6 |   $z = $y;

But got `string`

File "vector_invariant.php", line 4, character 22 - line 4, character 24:

 3 | function foo(): Vector<int> {
 4 |   $x =  Vector { 1 , »'2'« };
 5 |   $y = $x;
 6 |   $z = $y;

Here's why:

I checked the subtype constraint in [Main] because it was implied by the other constraints on the generic parameter `T` of `HH\Vector`.

Main

[Main] Step 1 of 1 (here is where the error occurred)

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this expression

File "vector_invariant.php", line 4, character 22 - line 4, character 24:

 3 | function foo(): Vector<int> {
 4 |   $x =  Vector { 1 , »'2'« };
 5 |   $y = $x;
 6 |   $z = $y;

The supertype comes from this hint

File "vector_invariant.php", line 3, character 24 - line 3, character 26:

 3 | function foo(): Vector<»int«> {
 4 |   $x =  Vector { 1 , '2' };
 5 |   $y = $x;
 6 |   $z = $y;
