error: Typing[4110] Invalid return type

Expected int

But got string

File vector_invariant.php, line 4, character 22 - line 4, character 24:

 7 |   // hh_force_solve();

This type argument to Vector must match exactly (it is invariant)

File vector_invariant.php, line 4, character 22 - line 4, character 24:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | 
 3 | function foo(): Vector<int> {
 4 |   $x =  Vector { 1 , »'2'« };
 5 |   $y = $x;
 6 |   $z = $y;
 7 |   // hh_force_solve();

Here's why:

I checked the subtype constraint in [Main] because it was implied by the other constraints on the generic parameter T of HH\Vector.

  [Main] Step 1 of 1                          (here is where the error occurred) 

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this expression

File vector_invariant.php, line 4, character 22 - line 4, character 24:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | 
 3 | function foo(): Vector<int> {
 4 |   $x =  Vector { 1 , »'2'« };
 5 |   $y = $x;
 6 |   $z = $y;
 7 |   // hh_force_solve();

The supertype comes from this hint

File vector_invariant.php, line 3, character 24 - line 3, character 26:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | 
 3 | function foo(): Vector<»int«> {
 4 |   $x =  Vector { 1 , '2' };
 5 |   $y = $x;
 6 |   $z = $y;
 7 |   // hh_force_solve();

I found the subtype for [Main] when I checked the subtype constraint in [Lower].

  [Lower] Step 1 of 1

 7 |   // hh_force_solve();

I found the supertype for [Main] when I checked the subtype constraint in [Upper].

  [Upper] Step 1 of 2

Vector is a class or interface so next I checked the 1st type arguments are subtypes.
The type parameter is invariant so the subtype relationship must hold in both directions.
Here I check the covariant case.

The subtype comes from this generic parameter T of HH\Vector
