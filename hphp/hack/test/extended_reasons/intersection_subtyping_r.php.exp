error: Typing[4110] Invalid return type

 8 |   return »$c«;

Expected `I`

 4 | class A {}

 7 | function inter_r(C $c) : (A & »I«) {
 8 |   return $c;
 9 | }

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 7, character 31 - line 7, character 31:

But got `C`

 4 | class A {}
 5 | class C extends A {}

Step 1 of 2

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this hint

 4 | class A {}
 5 | class C extends A {}
 6 | 
 7 | function inter_r(»C« $c) : (A & I) {
 8 |   return $c;
 9 | }

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 7, character 18 - line 7, character 18:

which is defined here

 4 | class A {}
 5 | class »C« extends A {}
 6 | 
 7 | function inter_r(C $c) : (A & I) {
 8 |   return $c;
 9 | }

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 5, character 7 - line 5, character 7:

and flows into this expression as the parameter hint

 4 | class A {}
 5 | class C extends A {}
 6 | 
 7 | function inter_r(C »$c«) : (A & I) {
 8 |   return $c;
 9 | }

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 7, character 20 - line 7, character 21:

which itself flows into this expression as the type of the local variable

 4 | class A {}
 5 | class C extends A {}
 6 | 
 7 | function inter_r(C $c) : (A & I) {
 8 |   return »$c«;
 9 | }

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 8, character 10 - line 8, character 11:

which itself flows into this expression because it is used in a return position

 4 | class A {}
 5 | class C extends A {}
 6 | 
 7 | function inter_r(C $c) : (A & I) {
 8 |   »return $c;«
 9 | }

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 8, character 3 - line 8, character 12:

The supertype comes from this hint

 4 | class A {}
 5 | class C extends A {}
 6 | 
 7 | function inter_r(C $c) : »(A & I)« {
 8 |   return $c;
 9 | }

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 7, character 26 - line 7, character 32:

Step 2 of 2

The supertype is an intersection type so next I checked each element of it was was a supertype of the subtype.

This step is the cause of the error.

The subtype is the same as before.

 4 | class A {}
 5 | class C extends A {}
 6 | 
 7 | function inter_r(»C« $c) : (A & I) {
 8 |   return $c;
 9 | }

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 7, character 18 - line 7, character 18:

The supertype comes from this hint

 4 | class A {}
 5 | class C extends A {}
 6 | 
 7 | function inter_r(C $c) : (A & »I«) {
 8 |   return $c;
 9 | }
