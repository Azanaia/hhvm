This error has 5 steps, a maximum depth of 1 and contains 0 reversals.

Here's why: this hint

 7 | function inter_r(»C« $c) : (A & I) {
 8 |   return $c;
 9 | }

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 7, character 18 - line 7, character 18:

flows into this expression because it is a parameter hint

 7 | function inter_r(C »$c«) : (A & I) {
 8 |   return $c;
 9 | }

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 7, character 20 - line 7, character 21:

which itself flows into this expression because the local variable has this type

 7 | function inter_r(C $c) : (A & I) {
 8 |   return »$c«;
 9 | }

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 8, character 10 - line 8, character 11:

which itself flows into this expression because the expression is in return position

 7 | function inter_r(C $c) : (A & I) {
 8 |   »return $c;«
 9 | }

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 8, character 3 - line 8, character 12:

which itself flows into this hint because they are required to be subtypes

 8 |   return $c;
 9 | }

File "intersection_subtyping_r.php", line 7, character 26 - line 7, character 32:

which itself flows down into this hint as an element of the intersection type
