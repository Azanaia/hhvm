Step 1 of 3

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this expression

File "refinment_is.php", line 8, character 3 - line 12, character 3:

  7 | function inter_is(A $a, C $c): C {
  8 |   »if($a is I) {

 10 |   } else {
 11 |     $z = $c;
 12 |   }«
 13 |   return $z;
 14 | }

and flows into this expression as the type of the local variable

File "refinment_is.php", line 13, character 10 - line 13, character 11:

 12 |   }
 13 |   return »$z«;
 14 | }

which itself flows into this expression because it is used in a return position

File "refinment_is.php", line 13, character 3 - line 13, character 12:

 12 |   }
 13 |   »return $z;«
 14 | }

The supertype comes from this hint

 8 |   if($a is I) {
 9 |     $z = $a;

Step 2 of 3

The subtype is a union type so next I checked each element of it was a subtype of the supertype.

The subtype comes from this `is` expression

File "refinment_is.php", line 8, character 6 - line 8, character 12:

10 |   } else {

Step 3 of 3

The subtype is an intersection type so next I checked at least one element of it was a subtype of the supertype.

This step is the cause of the error.
