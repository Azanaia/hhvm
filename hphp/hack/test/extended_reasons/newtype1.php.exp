error: Typing[4110] Invalid argument

File "newtype1.php--file2.php", line 8, character 22 - line 8, character 23:

 7 | function pass_my_int(myint $y) : bool {
 8 |   return expect_bool(»$y«);
 9 | }

Expected `bool`

File "newtype1.php--file2.php", line 3, character 22 - line 3, character 25:

 3 | function expect_bool(»bool« $x): bool {
 4 |   return $x;
 5 | }

But got `int`

File "newtype1.php--file1.php", line 3, character 18 - line 3, character 20:

 3 | newtype myint as »int« = int;

Step 1 of 3

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this function or method declaration

File "newtype1.php--file2.php", line 3, character 10 - line 3, character 20:

 3 | function »expect_bool«(bool $x): bool {
 4 |   return $x;
 5 | }

The supertype comes from this expression

File "newtype1.php--file2.php", line 8, character 10 - line 8, character 24:

 7 | function pass_my_int(myint $y) : bool {
 8 |   return »expect_bool($y)«;
 9 | }

Step 2 of 3

These are function types so next I checked the 1st function parameter of the supertype and subtype were subtypes (functions are contravariant in their parameters so the direction of the subtype relationship is reversed).

The subtype comes from this hint

File "newtype1.php--file2.php", line 7, character 22 - line 7, character 26:

 7 | function pass_my_int(»myint« $y) : bool {
 8 |   return expect_bool($y);
 9 | }

which is defined here

File "newtype1.php--file1.php", line 3, character 9 - line 3, character 13:

 3 | newtype »myint« as int = int;

and flows into this expression as the parameter hint

File "newtype1.php--file2.php", line 7, character 28 - line 7, character 29:

 7 | function pass_my_int(myint »$y«) : bool {
 8 |   return expect_bool($y);
 9 | }

which itself flows into this expression as the type of the local variable

File "newtype1.php--file2.php", line 8, character 22 - line 8, character 23:

 7 | function pass_my_int(myint $y) : bool {
 8 |   return expect_bool(»$y«);
 9 | }

The supertype comes from this hint

File "newtype1.php--file2.php", line 3, character 22 - line 3, character 25:

 3 | function expect_bool(»bool« $x): bool {
 4 |   return $x;
 5 | }

Step 3 of 3

The subtype declares an upper bound so next I checked that was a subtype of the supertype.

This step is the cause of the error.

The subtype comes from this hint

File "newtype1.php--file1.php", line 3, character 18 - line 3, character 20:

 3 | newtype myint as »int« = int;

The supertype is the same as before.

File "newtype1.php--file2.php", line 3, character 22 - line 3, character 25:

 3 | function expect_bool(»bool« $x): bool {
 4 |   return $x;
 5 | }
