error: Typing[4110] Invalid return type

 6 | function union_l((A | B) $ab): C {

Expected `C`

 6 | function union_l((A | B) $ab): »C« {
 7 |   return $ab;

But got `A`

Here's why:

Step 1 of 2

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this hint

File "union_subtyping_l.php", line 6, character 18 - line 6, character 24:

 6 | function union_l(»(A | B)« $ab): C {
 7 |   return $ab;
 8 | }

and flows into this expression as the parameter hint

File "union_subtyping_l.php", line 7, character 3 - line 7, character 13:

 6 | function union_l((A | B) $ab): C {
 7 |   »return $ab;«
 8 | }

The supertype comes from this hint

File "union_subtyping_l.php", line 6, character 32 - line 6, character 32:

 6 | function union_l((A | B) $ab): »C« {
 7 |   return $ab;
 8 | }

Step 2 of 2 (here is where the error occurred)

The subtype is a union type so next I checked the subtype constraint is satisfied for all its elements.

The subtype comes from this hint

 6 | function union_l((»A« | B) $ab): C {

The supertype is the same as before.
