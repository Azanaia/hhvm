Step 1 of 1

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

This step is the cause of the error.

The subtype comes from this type variable

 6 | function inter_equal(?A $a, C $c): C {
 7 |   if(»$a == null«) {
 8 |     $z = $a;
 9 |   } else {
10 |     $z = $c;

File "refinement_equal.php", line 7, character 6 - line 7, character 15:

and flows into this expression as the type of the local variable

 6 | function inter_equal(?A $a, C $c): C {
 7 |   if($a == null) {
 8 |     $z = »$a«;
 9 |   } else {
10 |     $z = $c;
