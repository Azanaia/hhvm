error: Typing[4110] Invalid return type

Expected `C`

 3 | class B {}
 4 | class C {}
 5 | 
 6 | function union_l((A | B) $ab): »C« {
 7 |   return $ab;
 8 | }

But got `A`

File "union_subtyping_l.php", line 6, character 19 - line 6, character 19:

 6 | function union_l((»A« | B) $ab): C {
 7 |   return $ab;
 8 | }

Here's why:

Step 1 of 2

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this hint

File "union_subtyping_l.php", line 6, character 18 - line 6, character 24:

 3 | class B {}
 4 | class C {}
 5 | 
 6 | function union_l(»(A | B)« $ab): C {
 7 |   return $ab;
 8 | }

and flows into this expression as the parameter hint

File "union_subtyping_l.php", line 6, character 26 - line 6, character 28:

 3 | class B {}
 4 | class C {}
 5 | 
 6 | function union_l((A | B) »$ab«): C {
 7 |   return $ab;
 8 | }

which itself flows into this expression as the type of the local variable

File "union_subtyping_l.php", line 7, character 10 - line 7, character 12:

 3 | class B {}
 4 | class C {}
 5 | 
 6 | function union_l((A | B) $ab): C {
 7 |   return »$ab«;
 8 | }

which itself flows into this expression because it is used in a return position

File "union_subtyping_l.php", line 7, character 3 - line 7, character 13:

 3 | class B {}
 4 | class C {}
 5 | 
 6 | function union_l((A | B) $ab): C {
 7 |   »return $ab;«
 8 | }

The supertype comes from this hint

File "union_subtyping_l.php", line 6, character 32 - line 6, character 32:

 3 | class B {}
 4 | class C {}
 5 | 
 6 | function union_l((A | B) $ab): »C« {
 7 |   return $ab;
 8 | }

which is defined here

 3 | class B {}
 4 | class »C« {}
 5 | 
 6 | function union_l((A | B) $ab): C {
 7 |   return $ab;
 8 | }

Step 2 of 2 (here is where the error occurred)

The subtype is a union type so next I checked all elements.
