Expected C

But got A

Here's why:


  Step 1 of 2                                                                   

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this hint

File union_subtyping_l.php, line 6, character 18 - line 6, character 24:

 2 | class A {}
 3 | class B {}
 4 | class C {}
 5 | 
 6 | function union_l(»(A | B)« $ab): C {
 7 |   return $ab;
 8 | }

and flows into this expression

File union_subtyping_l.php, line 6, character 26 - line 6, character 28:

 2 | class A {}
 3 | class B {}
 4 | class C {}
 5 | 
 6 | function union_l((A | B) »$ab«): C {
 7 |   return $ab;
 8 | }

as the parameter hint

which itself flows into this expression

File union_subtyping_l.php, line 7, character 10 - line 7, character 12:

 2 | class A {}
 3 | class B {}
 4 | class C {}
 5 | 
 6 | function union_l((A | B) $ab): C {
 7 |   return »$ab«;
 8 | }

as the type of the local variable

which itself flows into this expression

File union_subtyping_l.php, line 7, character 3 - line 7, character 13:

 2 | class A {}
 3 | class B {}
 4 | class C {}
 5 | 
 6 | function union_l((A | B) $ab): C {
 7 |   »return $ab;«
 8 | }

because it is used in a return position

The supertype comes from this hint

 8 | }


  Step 2 of 2                                 (here is where the error occurred) 

The subtype is a union type so next I checked the subtype constraint is satisfied for all its elements.
