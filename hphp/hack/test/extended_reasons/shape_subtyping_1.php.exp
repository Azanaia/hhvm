error: Typing[4110] Invalid argument

File shape_subtyping_1.php, line 11, character 29 - line 11, character 30:

  8 | function passes_required_a_at_bool(
  9 |   shape('a' => bool) $s,
 10 | ): void {

 12 | }

Expected int

File shape_subtyping_1.php, line 4, character 16 - line 4, character 18:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | 
 3 | function expects_required_a_at_int(
 4 |   shape('a' => »int«) $s,
 5 | ): void {
 6 | }

But got bool

File shape_subtyping_1.php, line 9, character 16 - line 9, character 19:

 8 | function passes_required_a_at_bool(
 9 |   shape('a' => »bool«) $s,
10 | ): void {
11 |   expects_required_a_at_int($s);
12 | }

Here's why:


  Step 1 of 3                                                                   

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this function or method declaration

File shape_subtyping_1.php, line 3, character 10 - line 3, character 34:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | 
 3 | function »expects_required_a_at_int«(
 4 |   shape('a' => int) $s,
 5 | ): void {
 6 | }

The supertype comes from this expression

File shape_subtyping_1.php, line 11, character 3 - line 11, character 31:

  8 | function passes_required_a_at_bool(
  9 |   shape('a' => bool) $s,
 10 | ): void {
 11 |   »expects_required_a_at_int($s)«;
 12 | }


  Step 2 of 3                                                                   

These are function types so next I checked the 1st function parameters.
Functions are contravariant in their parameters so the direction of the subtype relationship is reversed.

The subtype comes from this hint

File shape_subtyping_1.php, line 9, character 3 - line 9, character 20:

 8 | function passes_required_a_at_bool(
 9 |   »shape('a' => bool)« $s,
10 | ): void {
11 |   expects_required_a_at_int($s);
12 | }

and flows into this expression

File shape_subtyping_1.php, line 9, character 22 - line 9, character 23:

 8 | function passes_required_a_at_bool(
 9 |   shape('a' => bool) »$s«,
10 | ): void {
11 |   expects_required_a_at_int($s);
12 | }

as the parameter hint

which itself flows into this expression

File shape_subtyping_1.php, line 11, character 29 - line 11, character 30:

  8 | function passes_required_a_at_bool(
  9 |   shape('a' => bool) $s,
 10 | ): void {
 11 |   expects_required_a_at_int(»$s«);
 12 | }

as the type of the local variable

The supertype comes from this hint

File shape_subtyping_1.php, line 4, character 3 - line 4, character 19:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | 
 3 | function expects_required_a_at_int(
 4 |   »shape('a' => int)« $s,
 5 | ): void {
 6 | }


  Step 3 of 3                                 (here is where the error occurred) 

These are shape types so next I checked the required a field.

The subtype comes from this hint

File shape_subtyping_1.php, line 9, character 16 - line 9, character 19:

 8 | function passes_required_a_at_bool(
 9 |   shape('a' => »bool«) $s,
10 | ): void {
11 |   expects_required_a_at_int($s);
12 | }

The supertype comes from this hint

File shape_subtyping_1.php, line 4, character 16 - line 4, character 18:
