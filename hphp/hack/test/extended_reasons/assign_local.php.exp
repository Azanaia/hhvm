error: Typing[4110] Invalid argument

File "assign_local.php", line 11, character 7 - line 11, character 8:

  9 | function bar(Super $f): void {
 10 |   $g = $f;
 11 |   foo(»$g«);
 12 | }

Expected `Sub`

File "assign_local.php", line 7, character 14 - line 7, character 16:

 3 | class Super {}
 4 | class Sub extends Super {}
 5 | 
 6 | 
 7 | function foo(»Sub« $_): void {}
 8 | 
 9 | function bar(Super $f): void {

But got `Super`

File "assign_local.php", line 9, character 14 - line 9, character 18:

 9 | function bar(»Super« $f): void {
10 |   $g = $f;
11 |   foo($g);
12 | }

Step 1 of 2

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this function or method declaration

File "assign_local.php", line 7, character 10 - line 7, character 12:

 3 | class Super {}
 4 | class Sub extends Super {}
 5 | 
 6 | 
 7 | function »foo«(Sub $_): void {}
 8 | 
 9 | function bar(Super $f): void {

The supertype comes from this expression

File "assign_local.php", line 11, character 3 - line 11, character 9:

  9 | function bar(Super $f): void {
 10 |   $g = $f;
 11 |   »foo($g)«;
 12 | }

Step 2 of 2

These are function types so next I checked the 1st function parameter of the supertype and subtype were subtypes (functions are contravariant in their parameters so the direction of the subtype relationship is reversed).

This step is the cause of the error.

The subtype comes from this hint

File "assign_local.php", line 9, character 14 - line 9, character 18:

 9 | function bar(»Super« $f): void {
10 |   $g = $f;
11 |   foo($g);
12 | }

which is defined here

File "assign_local.php", line 3, character 7 - line 3, character 11:

 3 | class »Super« {}
 4 | class Sub extends Super {}

and flows into this expression as the parameter hint

File "assign_local.php", line 9, character 20 - line 9, character 21:

 9 | function bar(Super »$f«): void {
10 |   $g = $f;
11 |   foo($g);
12 | }

which itself flows into this expression as the type of the local variable

File "assign_local.php", line 10, character 8 - line 10, character 9:

 9 | function bar(Super $f): void {
10 |   $g = »$f«;
11 |   foo($g);
12 | }

which itself flows into this expression via an assignment

File "assign_local.php", line 10, character 3 - line 10, character 4:

 9 | function bar(Super $f): void {
10 |   »$g« = $f;
11 |   foo($g);
12 | }

which itself flows into this expression as the type of the local variable

File "assign_local.php", line 11, character 7 - line 11, character 8:

  9 | function bar(Super $f): void {
 10 |   $g = $f;
 11 |   foo(»$g«);
 12 | }

The supertype comes from this hint

File "assign_local.php", line 7, character 14 - line 7, character 16:

 3 | class Super {}
 4 | class Sub extends Super {}
 5 | 
 6 | 
 7 | function foo(»Sub« $_): void {}
 8 | 
 9 | function bar(Super $f): void {

which is defined here

File "assign_local.php", line 4, character 7 - line 4, character 9:

 3 | class Super {}
 4 | class »Sub« extends Super {}
 5 |
