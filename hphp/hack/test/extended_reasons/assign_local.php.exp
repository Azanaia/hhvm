error: Typing[4110] Invalid argument

File assign_local.php, line 11, character 7 - line 11, character 8:

  7 | function foo(Sub $_): void {}
  8 | 
  9 | function bar(Super $f): void {
 10 |   $g = $f;
 11 |   foo(»$g«);
 12 | }

Expected Sub

File assign_local.php, line 7, character 14 - line 7, character 16:

 3 | class Super {}
 4 | class Sub extends Super {}
 5 | 
 6 | 
 7 | function foo(»Sub« $_): void {}
 8 | 
 9 | function bar(Super $f): void {
10 |   $g = $f;

But got Super

File assign_local.php, line 9, character 14 - line 9, character 18:

 7 | function foo(Sub $_): void {}
 8 | 
 9 | function bar(»Super« $f): void {
10 |   $g = $f;
11 |   foo($g);
12 | }

Here's why:


  Step 1 of 2                                                      

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this function or method declaration

File assign_local.php, line 7, character 10 - line 7, character 12:

 3 | class Super {}
 4 | class Sub extends Super {}
 5 | 
 6 | 
 7 | function »foo«(Sub $_): void {}
 8 | 
 9 | function bar(Super $f): void {
10 |   $g = $f;

The supertype comes from this expression

File assign_local.php, line 11, character 3 - line 11, character 9:

  7 | function foo(Sub $_): void {}
  8 | 
  9 | function bar(Super $f): void {
 10 |   $g = $f;
 11 |   »foo($g)«;
 12 | }


  Step 2 of 2                    (here is where the error occurred) 

These are function types so next I checked the 1st function parameters.
Functions are contravariant in their parameters so the direction of the subtype relationship is reversed.

The subtype comes from this hint

File assign_local.php, line 9, character 14 - line 9, character 18:

 7 | function foo(Sub $_): void {}
 8 | 
 9 | function bar(»Super« $f): void {
10 |   $g = $f;
11 |   foo($g);
12 | }

which is defined here

File assign_local.php, line 3, character 7 - line 3, character 11:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | 
 3 | class »Super« {}
 4 | class Sub extends Super {}
 5 | 

and flows into this expression

File assign_local.php, line 9, character 20 - line 9, character 21:

 7 | function foo(Sub $_): void {}
 8 | 
 9 | function bar(Super »$f«): void {
10 |   $g = $f;
11 |   foo($g);
12 | }

as the parameter hint

which itself flows into this expression

File assign_local.php, line 10, character 8 - line 10, character 9:

 7 | function foo(Sub $_): void {}
 8 | 
 9 | function bar(Super $f): void {
10 |   $g = »$f«;
11 |   foo($g);
12 | }

as the type of the local variable

which itself flows into this expression

File assign_local.php, line 10, character 3 - line 10, character 4:

 7 | function foo(Sub $_): void {}
 8 | 
 9 | function bar(Super $f): void {
10 |   »$g« = $f;
11 |   foo($g);
12 | }

via an assignment

which itself flows into this expression

  7 | function foo(Sub $_): void {}
  8 | 
  9 | function bar(Super $f): void {
 10 |   $g = $f;
 11 |   foo(»$g«);
 12 | }

as the type of the local variable

The supertype comes from this hint

File assign_local.php, line 7, character 14 - line 7, character 16:

 3 | class Super {}
