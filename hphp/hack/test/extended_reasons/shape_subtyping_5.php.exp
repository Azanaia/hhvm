The field a is optional

The field a is defined as required

Here's why:


  Step 1 of 3                                                      

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this function or method declaration

File shape_subtyping_5.php, line 6, character 10 - line 6, character 40:

 3 | type required_a_at_int = shape('a' => int);
 4 | type optional_a_at_int = shape(?'a' => int);
 5 | 
 6 | function »expects_required_a_at_int_alias«(
 7 | required_a_at_int $s,
 8 | ): void {
 9 | }

The supertype comes from this expression

File shape_subtyping_5.php, line 14, character 3 - line 14, character 37:

 11 | function passes_optional_a_at_int_alias(
 12 |   optional_a_at_int $s,
 13 | ): void {
 14 |   »expects_required_a_at_int_alias($s)«;
 15 | }


  Step 2 of 3                                                      

These are function types so next I checked the 1st function parameters.
Functions are contravariant in their parameters so the direction of the subtype relationship is reversed.

The subtype comes from this hint

File shape_subtyping_5.php, line 12, character 3 - line 12, character 19:

 11 | function passes_optional_a_at_int_alias(
 12 |   »optional_a_at_int« $s,
 13 | ): void {
 14 |   expects_required_a_at_int_alias($s);
 15 | }

which is defined here

File shape_subtyping_5.php, line 4, character 26 - line 4, character 43:

 3 | type required_a_at_int = shape('a' => int);
 4 | type optional_a_at_int = »shape(?'a' => int)«;
 5 | 
 6 | function expects_required_a_at_int_alias(
 7 | required_a_at_int $s,
 8 | ): void {
 9 | }

and flows into this expression

File shape_subtyping_5.php, line 12, character 21 - line 12, character 22:

 11 | function passes_optional_a_at_int_alias(
 12 |   optional_a_at_int »$s«,
 13 | ): void {
 14 |   expects_required_a_at_int_alias($s);
 15 | }

as the parameter hint

which itself flows into this expression

File shape_subtyping_5.php, line 14, character 35 - line 14, character 36:

 11 | function passes_optional_a_at_int_alias(
 12 |   optional_a_at_int $s,
 13 | ): void {
 14 |   expects_required_a_at_int_alias(»$s«);
 15 | }

as the type of the local variable

The supertype comes from this hint

File shape_subtyping_5.php, line 7, character 1 - line 7, character 17:

 3 | type required_a_at_int = shape('a' => int);
 4 | type optional_a_at_int = shape(?'a' => int);
 5 | 
 6 | function expects_required_a_at_int_alias(
 7 | »required_a_at_int« $s,
 8 | ): void {
 9 | }

which is defined here

File shape_subtyping_5.php, line 3, character 26 - line 3, character 42:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | 
 3 | type required_a_at_int = »shape('a' => int)«;
 4 | type optional_a_at_int = shape(?'a' => int);
 5 | 
 6 | function expects_required_a_at_int_alias(


  Step 3 of 3                    (here is where the error occurred) 

These are shape types so next I checked the a field.
The field was optional in the subtype and required in the supertype.

The subtype comes from this hint

File shape_subtyping_5.php, line 4, character 40 - line 4, character 42:

 3 | type required_a_at_int = shape('a' => int);
 4 | type optional_a_at_int = shape(?'a' => »int«);

 6 | function expects_required_a_at_int_alias(
