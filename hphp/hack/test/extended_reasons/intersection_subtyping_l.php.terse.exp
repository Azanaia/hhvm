Step 1 of 1 (here is where the error occurred)

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this hint

 7 | function inter_l(»(A & I)« $ai): C {
 8 |   $c = $ai;

10 | }

and flows into this expression as the parameter hint

 7 | function inter_l((A & I) $ai): C {

The supertype comes from this hint

Step 2 of 2 (here is where the error occurred)

The subtype is an intersection type so next I checked that the subtype constraint is satisfied for at least one of its element.
