Step 1 of 3

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this function or method declaration

 3 | function »expects_required_a_at_int«(
 4 |   shape('a' => int) $s,
 5 | ): void {
 6 | }

File "shape_subtyping_2.php", line 3, character 10 - line 3, character 34:

The supertype comes from this expression

  8 | function passes_optional_a_at_int(
  9 |   shape(?'a' => int) $s,
 10 | ): void {
 11 |   »expects_required_a_at_int($s)«;
 12 | }

File "shape_subtyping_2.php", line 11, character 3 - line 11, character 31:

Step 2 of 3

These are function types so next I checked the 1st function parameter of the supertype and subtype were subtypes (functions are contravariant in their parameters so the direction of the subtype relationship is reversed).

The subtype comes from this hint

 8 | function passes_optional_a_at_int(
 9 |   »shape(?'a' => int)« $s,
10 | ): void {
11 |   expects_required_a_at_int($s);
12 | }

File "shape_subtyping_2.php", line 9, character 3 - line 9, character 20:

and flows into this expression as the parameter hint

 8 | function passes_optional_a_at_int(
 9 |   shape(?'a' => int) »$s«,
10 | ): void {
11 |   expects_required_a_at_int($s);
12 | }

File "shape_subtyping_2.php", line 9, character 22 - line 9, character 23:

which itself flows into this expression as the type of the local variable

  8 | function passes_optional_a_at_int(
  9 |   shape(?'a' => int) $s,
 10 | ): void {
 11 |   expects_required_a_at_int(»$s«);
 12 | }

File "shape_subtyping_2.php", line 11, character 29 - line 11, character 30:

The supertype comes from this hint

 3 | function expects_required_a_at_int(
 4 |   »shape('a' => int)« $s,
 5 | ): void {
 6 | }

File "shape_subtyping_2.php", line 4, character 3 - line 4, character 19:

Step 3 of 3

These are shape types so next I checked the `a` fields were subtypes. The field was optional in the subtype and required in the supertype.

This step is the cause of the error.

The subtype comes from this hint

 8 | function passes_optional_a_at_int(
 9 |   shape(?'a' => »int«) $s,
10 | ): void {
11 |   expects_required_a_at_int($s);
12 | }

File "shape_subtyping_2.php", line 9, character 17 - line 9, character 19:

The supertype comes from this hint

 3 | function expects_required_a_at_int(
 4 |   shape('a' => »int«) $s,
 5 | ): void {
 6 | }
