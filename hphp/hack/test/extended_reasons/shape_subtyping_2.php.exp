error: Typing[4163] Invalid argument

The field `a` is **optional**

File "shape_subtyping_2.php", line 9, character 3 - line 9, character 20:

 8 | function passes_optional_a_at_int(
 9 |   »shape(?'a' => int)« $s,
10 | ): void {
11 |   expects_required_a_at_int($s);
12 | }

The field `a` is defined as **required**

File "shape_subtyping_2.php", line 4, character 3 - line 4, character 19:

 3 | function expects_required_a_at_int(
 4 |   »shape('a' => int)« $s,
 5 | ): void {
 6 | }

`a` is defined here

File "shape_subtyping_2.php", line 4, character 16 - line 4, character 18:

 3 | function expects_required_a_at_int(
 4 |   shape('a' => »int«) $s,
 5 | ): void {
 6 | }

Here's why:


Step 1 of 3

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this function or method declaration

File "shape_subtyping_2.php", line 3, character 10 - line 3, character 34:

 3 | function »expects_required_a_at_int«(
 4 |   shape('a' => int) $s,
 5 | ): void {
 6 | }

The supertype comes from this expression

File "shape_subtyping_2.php", line 11, character 3 - line 11, character 31:

  8 | function passes_optional_a_at_int(
  9 |   shape(?'a' => int) $s,
 10 | ): void {
 11 |   »expects_required_a_at_int($s)«;
 12 | }


Step 2 of 3

These are function types so next I checked the 1st function parameters.
Functions are contravariant in their parameters so the direction of the subtype relationship is reversed.

The subtype comes from this hint

File "shape_subtyping_2.php", line 9, character 3 - line 9, character 20:

 8 | function passes_optional_a_at_int(
 9 |   »shape(?'a' => int)« $s,
10 | ): void {
11 |   expects_required_a_at_int($s);
12 | }

and flows into this expression

File "shape_subtyping_2.php", line 9, character 22 - line 9, character 23:

 8 | function passes_optional_a_at_int(
 9 |   shape(?'a' => int) »$s«,
10 | ): void {
11 |   expects_required_a_at_int($s);
12 | }

as the parameter hint

which itself flows into this expression

File "shape_subtyping_2.php", line 11, character 29 - line 11, character 30:

  8 | function passes_optional_a_at_int(
  9 |   shape(?'a' => int) $s,
 10 | ): void {
 11 |   expects_required_a_at_int(»$s«);
 12 | }

as the type of the local variable

The supertype comes from this hint

File "shape_subtyping_2.php", line 4, character 3 - line 4, character 19:

 3 | function expects_required_a_at_int(
 4 |   »shape('a' => int)« $s,
 5 | ): void {
 6 | }


Step 3 of 3 (here is where the error occurred)

These are shape types so next I checked the `a` field.
The field was optional in the subtype and required in the supertype.

The subtype comes from this hint

File "shape_subtyping_2.php", line 9, character 17 - line 9, character 19:

 8 | function passes_optional_a_at_int(
 9 |   shape(?'a' => »int«) $s,
10 | ): void {
11 |   expects_required_a_at_int($s);
12 | }

The supertype comes from this hint

File "shape_subtyping_2.php", line 4, character 16 - line 4, character 18:

 3 | function expects_required_a_at_int(
 4 |   shape('a' => »int«) $s,
 5 | ): void {
 6 | }
