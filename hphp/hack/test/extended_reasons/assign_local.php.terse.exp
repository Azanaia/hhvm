error: Typing[4110] Invalid argument

File "assign_local.php", line 11, character 7 - line 11, character 8:

  9 | function bar(Super $f): void {
 10 |   $g = $f;
 11 |   foo(»$g«);
 12 | }

Expected `Sub`

File "assign_local.php", line 7, character 14 - line 7, character 16:

 7 | function foo(»Sub« $_): void {}
 8 | 
 9 | function bar(Super $f): void {

But got `Super`

File "assign_local.php", line 9, character 14 - line 9, character 18:

 9 | function bar(»Super« $f): void {
10 |   $g = $f;
11 |   foo($g);
12 | }

Here's why:

Step 1 of 2

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this function or method declaration

File "assign_local.php", line 7, character 10 - line 7, character 12:

 7 | function »foo«(Sub $_): void {}
 8 | 
 9 | function bar(Super $f): void {

The supertype comes from this expression

File "assign_local.php", line 11, character 3 - line 11, character 9:

  9 | function bar(Super $f): void {
 10 |   $g = $f;
 11 |   »foo($g)«;
 12 | }

Step 2 of 2 (here is where the error occurred)

These are function types so next I checked the 1st function parameters.
Functions are contravariant in their parameters so the direction of the subtype relationship is reversed.

The subtype comes from this hint

File "assign_local.php", line 9, character 14 - line 9, character 18:

 9 | function bar(»Super« $f): void {
10 |   $g = $f;
11 |   foo($g);
12 | }

and flows into this expression as the parameter hint

File "assign_local.php", line 11, character 7 - line 11, character 8:

  9 | function bar(Super $f): void {
 10 |   $g = $f;
 11 |   foo(»$g«);
 12 | }

The supertype comes from this hint

File "assign_local.php", line 7, character 14 - line 7, character 16:

 7 | function foo(»Sub« $_): void {}
 8 | 
 9 | function bar(Super $f): void {
