error: Typing[4110] Invalid argument

File "assign_obj_get.php", line 16, character 7 - line 16, character 8:

 15 |   $g = $f->get();
 16 |   foo(»$g«);
 17 | }

Expected `Sub`

File "assign_obj_get.php", line 12, character 14 - line 12, character 16:

 12 | function foo(»Sub« $_): void {}
 13 | 
 14 | function bar(SuperBox $f): void {

But got `Super`

File "assign_obj_get.php", line 7, character 26 - line 7, character 30:

 6 |   public function __construct(private Super $item) {}
 7 |   public function get(): »Super« {
 8 |     return $this->item;
 9 |   }

Here's why:

Step 1 of 2

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this function or method declaration

File "assign_obj_get.php", line 12, character 10 - line 12, character 12:

 12 | function »foo«(Sub $_): void {}
 13 | 
 14 | function bar(SuperBox $f): void {

The supertype comes from this expression

File "assign_obj_get.php", line 16, character 3 - line 16, character 9:

 15 |   $g = $f->get();
 16 |   »foo($g)«;
 17 | }

Step 2 of 2 (here is where the error occurred)

These are function types so next I checked the 1st function parameters.
Functions are contravariant in their parameters so the direction of the subtype relationship is reversed.

The subtype comes from this hint

File "assign_obj_get.php", line 7, character 26 - line 7, character 30:

 6 |   public function __construct(private Super $item) {}
 7 |   public function get(): »Super« {
 8 |     return $this->item;
 9 |   }

and flows into this expression as the return type of the function call

File "assign_obj_get.php", line 16, character 7 - line 16, character 8:

 15 |   $g = $f->get();
 16 |   foo(»$g«);
 17 | }

The supertype comes from this hint

File "assign_obj_get.php", line 12, character 14 - line 12, character 16:

 12 | function foo(»Sub« $_): void {}
 13 | 
 14 | function bar(SuperBox $f): void {
