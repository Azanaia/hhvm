Here's why:

Step 1 of 3

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this join point

File "refinment_is.php", line 8, character 3 - line 12, character 3:

  7 | function inter_is(A $a, C $c): C {
  8 |   »if($a is I) {
  9 |     $z = $a;
 10 |   } else {
 11 |     $z = $c;
 12 |   }«
 13 |   return $z;
 14 | }

and flows into this expression as the type of the local variable

File "refinment_is.php", line 13, character 3 - line 13, character 12:

 7 | function inter_is(A $a, C $c): »C« {
 8 |   if($a is I) {
 9 |     $z = $a;

Step 2 of 3

The subtype is a union type so next I checked all elements.

The subtype comes from this `is` expression

 7 | function inter_is(A $a, C $c): C {

10 |   } else {
11 |     $z = $c;

Step 3 of 3 (here is where the error occurred)

The subtype is an intersection type so next I checked that at least one element.

The subtype comes from this hint
