error: Typing[4110] Invalid return type

File "num.php", line 9, character 10 - line 9, character 15:

 8 |   $x = 5 + $x;
 9 |   return »5 + $x«;
10 | }

Expected `string`

File "num.php", line 3, character 23 - line 3, character 28:

 3 | function foo(num $n): »string« {
 4 |   $x = 5 + $n;
 5 |   $x = 5 + $x;

But got `float` because this is the result of an arithmetic operation with a `num` as the second argument, and no `float`s.

File "num.php", line 9, character 10 - line 9, character 15:

 8 |   $x = 5 + $x;
 9 |   return »5 + $x«;
10 | }

Here is why I think the argument is a `num`: this is a `num`

File "num.php", line 3, character 14 - line 3, character 16:

 3 | function foo(»num« $n): string {
 4 |   $x = 5 + $n;
 5 |   $x = 5 + $x;

Here's why:


Step 1 of 2

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this arithmetic expression

File "num.php", line 9, character 10 - line 9, character 15:

 8 |   $x = 5 + $x;
 9 |   return »5 + $x«;
10 | }

and flows into this expression

File "num.php", line 9, character 3 - line 9, character 16:

 8 |   $x = 5 + $x;
 9 |   »return 5 + $x;«
10 | }

because it is used in a return position

The supertype comes from this hint

File "num.php", line 3, character 23 - line 3, character 28:

 3 | function foo(num $n): »string« {
 4 |   $x = 5 + $n;
 5 |   $x = 5 + $x;


Step 2 of 2 (here is where the error occurred)

The subtype is a num type so next I checked the subtype constraint is satisfied for both the int and float parts.

The subtype comes from this arithmetic expression

File "num.php", line 9, character 10 - line 9, character 15:

 8 |   $x = 5 + $x;

 8 |   $x = 5 + $x;
 9 |   »return 5 + $x;«

The supertype is the same as before.
