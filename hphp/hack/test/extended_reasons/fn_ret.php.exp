error: Typing[4110] Invalid return type

File "fn_ret.php", line 8, character 10 - line 8, character 14:

 7 | function bar(): bool {
 8 |   return »foo()«;
 9 | }

Expected `bool`

File "fn_ret.php", line 7, character 17 - line 7, character 20:

 7 | function bar(): »bool« {
 8 |   return foo();
 9 | }

But got `int`

File "fn_ret.php", line 3, character 17 - line 3, character 19:

 3 | function foo(): »int« {
 4 |   return 1;
 5 | }

Step 1 of 1

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

This step is the cause of the error.

The subtype comes from this hint

File "fn_ret.php", line 3, character 17 - line 3, character 19:

 3 | function foo(): »int« {
 4 |   return 1;
 5 | }

The supertype comes from this hint

File "fn_ret.php", line 7, character 17 - line 7, character 20:

 7 | function bar(): »bool« {
 8 |   return foo();
 9 | }

This step is the cause of the error.

The subtype comes from this hint

File "fn_ret.php", line 3, character 17 - line 3, character 19:

 3 | function foo(): »int« {
 4 |   return 1;
 5 | }

and flows into this expression because of a function call

File "fn_ret.php", line 8, character 10 - line 8, character 14:

 7 | function bar(): bool {
 8 |   return »foo()«;
 9 | }

which itself flows into this expression because it is used in a return position

File "fn_ret.php", line 8, character 3 - line 8, character 15:

 7 | function bar(): bool {
 8 |   »return foo();«
 9 | }

The supertype comes from this hint

 7 | function bar(): »bool« {
 8 |   return foo();
 9 | }
