error: Typing[4110] Invalid return type

File "union_join_point.php", line 12, character 10 - line 12, character 11:

  8 |   } else{
  9 |     $z = $y;
 10 |   }
 11 | 
 12 |   return »$z«;
 13 | }

Expected `A`

File "union_join_point.php", line 5, character 37 - line 5, character 37:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | class A {}
 3 | class B {}
 4 | 
 5 | function foo(bool  $p, A $x, B $y): »A« {
 6 |   if($p){
 7 |     $z = $x;

But got `B`

File "union_join_point.php", line 5, character 30 - line 5, character 30:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | class A {}
 3 | class B {}
 4 | 
 5 | function foo(bool  $p, A $x, »B« $y): A {
 6 |   if($p){
 7 |     $z = $x;

Step 1 of 2

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this expression

File "union_join_point.php", line 6, character 3 - line 10, character 3:

 5 | function foo(bool  $p, A $x, B $y): A {
 6 |   »if($p){
 7 |     $z = $x;
 8 |   } else{
 9 |     $z = $y;
10 |   }«
11 | 
12 |   return $z;

and flows into this expression as the type of the local variable

File "union_join_point.php", line 12, character 10 - line 12, character 11:

  8 |   } else{
  9 |     $z = $y;
 10 |   }
 11 | 
 12 |   return »$z«;
 13 | }

which itself flows into this expression because it is used in a return position

File "union_join_point.php", line 12, character 3 - line 12, character 12:

  8 |   } else{
  9 |     $z = $y;
 10 |   }
 11 | 
 12 |   »return $z;«
 13 | }

The supertype comes from this hint

File "union_join_point.php", line 5, character 37 - line 5, character 37:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | class A {}
 3 | class B {}
 4 | 
 5 | function foo(bool  $p, A $x, B $y): »A« {
 6 |   if($p){
 7 |     $z = $x;

which is defined here

File "union_join_point.php", line 2, character 7 - line 2, character 7:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | class »A« {}
 3 | class B {}
 4 | 
 5 | function foo(bool  $p, A $x, B $y): A {
 6 |   if($p){
 7 |     $z = $x;

Step 2 of 2

The subtype is a union type so next I checked each element of it was a subtype of the supertype.

This step is the cause of the error.

The subtype comes from this hint

File "union_join_point.php", line 5, character 30 - line 5, character 30:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | class A {}
 3 | class B {}
 4 | 
 5 | function foo(bool  $p, A $x, »B« $y): A {
 6 |   if($p){
 7 |     $z = $x;

which is defined here

File "union_join_point.php", line 3, character 7 - line 3, character 7:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | class A {}
 3 | class »B« {}
 4 | 
 5 | function foo(bool  $p, A $x, B $y): A {
 6 |   if($p){
 7 |     $z = $x;

and flows into this expression as the parameter hint

File "union_join_point.php", line 5, character 32 - line 5, character 33:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | class A {}
 3 | class B {}
 4 | 
 5 | function foo(bool  $p, A $x, B »$y«): A {
 6 |   if($p){
 7 |     $z = $x;

which itself flows into this expression as the type of the local variable

File "union_join_point.php", line 9, character 10 - line 9, character 11:

 8 |   } else{
 9 |     $z = »$y«;
10 |   }
11 | 
12 |   return $z;
13 | }

which itself flows into this expression via an assignment

File "union_join_point.php", line 9, character 5 - line 9, character 6:

 8 |   } else{
 9 |     »$z« = $y;
10 |   }
11 | 
12 |   return $z;
13 | }

The supertype is the same as before.

File "union_join_point.php", line 5, character 37 - line 5, character 37:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | class A {}
 3 | class B {}
 4 | 
 5 | function foo(bool  $p, A $x, B $y): »A« {
 6 |   if($p){
 7 |     $z = $x;
