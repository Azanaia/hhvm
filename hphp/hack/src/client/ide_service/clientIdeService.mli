(** Provides IDE services in the client, without an instance of hh_server
running.

Basic approach: we load the naming table to give us just enough symbol
information to provide IDE services for just the files you're looking at. When
we need to look up declarations to service an IDE query, we parse and typecheck
the files containing those declarations on-demand, then answer your IDE query.

(** This function does an rpc to the daemon: it pushes a message
onto the daemon's stdin queue, then awaits until [serve] has stuck
the stdout response from the daemon response onto our [response_emitter].
The daemon updates [ref_unblocked_time], the time at which the
daemon starting handling the rpc.

Our only caller of this function is [ClientLsp.ide_rpc], which aims
to uphold the invariant that it never makes two concurrent calls
to this function. We support that invariant here by logging an
invariant_violation_bug should it occur, but that's only to help
our caller; this function supports being called while an existing
rpc is outstanding, and guarantees that its results will be
delivered in order.

The progress callback will be invoked during this call to rpc, at times
when the result of [get_status t] might have changed. It's designed
so the caller of rpc can, in their callback, invoke get_status and display
some kind of progress message.

Note: it is not safe to Lwt.cancel this method, since we might end up
with no one reading the response to the message we just pushed, leading
to desync.

Note: If we're in Stopped state (due to someone calling [stop]) then
we'll refrain from sending the rpc. Stopped is the only state we enter
due to our own volition; all other states are just a reflection
of what state the daemon is in, and so it's fine for the daemon
to respond as it see fits while in the other states. *)
