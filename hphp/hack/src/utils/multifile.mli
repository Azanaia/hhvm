  Indeed, there are some features that require mutliple files to be tested.
  For example, newtype has a different meaning depending on the file. *)

  ```
  //// x.php
  <?hh
  type F = int

  //// y.php
  <?hh
  type G = float

  ```

  [file_to_files] will return a map

or just (DummyRoot, "/home/ljw/chess.php") if there weren't any multifiles within the file.
This function strips both to "chess.php", a more appropriate rendering for test output. *)
