(** This awaits until a message is found which satisfies the predicate,

If the message was already in the queue at the time this function was called,
then the returned promise will be already-completed.
If [cancellation_token] is fired before a message is found, then
the returned promise will get resolved with [None].
If there's a fault with the incoming file-descriptor like EOF, the returned promise
also gets resolved to [None]. *)
