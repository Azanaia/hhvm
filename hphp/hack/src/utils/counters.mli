module Category : sig

  and we should keep the number small... 5 to 10 items here are fine, but more will be a problem. *)

    | Direct_decl_parse
        (** This is counted every use of [Direct_decl_utils.direct_decl_parse{_and_cache}].
        It often includes some [Disk_cat] time. *)
    | Decl_provider_get
        (** This measures every [Decl_provider.get_*] function. In cases where it's not already
        in the cache, this will also include calls to [Direct_decl_parse] hence also [Disk_cat],
        and also time to do decl-folding. *)
    | Ast_provider_get
        (** This measures every [Ast_provider.get_ast_with_error] call, for fetching the full ASTs of the files
        we're typechecking. It is inclusive of [Disk_cat] time.
        Note that this is *not* used for direct-decl-parsing. *)
    | Typing_toplevel
        (** This measures every [Typing_top_level] call. It will often include [Decl_provider_get]
        and hence [Direct_decl_parse] and [Disk_cat] for all the decls it needs.
        It doesn't include the call to [Ast_provider_get] for fetching the AST of the
        file we're typechecking; that's already been done prior. *)
